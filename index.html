            <h1> Hello everyone!</h1>
              <p><h3>I’m so excited to share this tool with you guys, as it’s something I found last year, and it’s been my saving grace for digital learning. Like many people, I prefer hard copy over digitized copy as annotating is imperative to my learning and overall comprehension process, but after finding Wavea I’ve noticed that more often than not, I turn to digital annotating over my hard copy annotating.</p>
                <p><h3>Weava is a neat little workspace tool that takes your reading process a step further by not only allowing you to highlight anywhere, but allows you to click on the highlighted text, and further flush out your thoughts in an annotation. All of your highlights and annotations are saved within the cloud, and available for access on the Wavea dashboard that allows you to organize your highlighted documents/webpages into folders/subfolders, and from said dashboard, you’re also granted access to the original source via hyper-link.</h3></p>
                  <p><h3>Not only that, but Weava also enhances the research experience by also permitting the user to create citations per highlighted document—whether you’re citing a book, a website, a journal article, or more, Wavea has got your back for convenience sake. As Weava literally works with you and caters to your needs, it’s loved by students, professors, researchers, business professionals are more for its easy usability, and its flexibility. Overall, Weava is engaging, and it
                    makes the digital experience a little more personalized.</h3></p>

              <p><h3><a href="https://www.weavatools.com/">Weava</a> is a simple-to-access tool downloadable through the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/weava-highlighter-pdf-web/cbnaodkpfinfiipjblikofhlhlcickei?hl=en">Google Chrome store</a> and available as a free version with the features that we’ll be covering, or, a paid option with more advance features such as more custom colors, sub folders, drag-and-drop image clipping, collaboration, and little more storage. We won’t be getting too much into that, but everything that we’re doing in this tutorial are the elements most pertinent to the overall integrity of the tool.</h3></p>

            <h1>The first task at hand is to do the foundational feature of Weava: highlight.</h1>
              <p><h3>The best way that you can test out your new tool is to head on over to the <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~cm395/theBeeMovieScript/"><em>Bee Movie</em></a> script and highlight your heart out. Obviously, there’s nothing that’s not worth highlighting on that script—it’s comedic gold. But, if you’re not into <em>Bee Movie</em>, maybe you’re into what the world is going to look like in year million. If so, maybe highlight some interesting quotes from this article <a href="https://www.livescience.com/59115-year-million-series-explores-future-of-humanity.html">here.</a> Or, you can revist a PDF file and highlight some things you might've missed before this tool! Quite frankly, there’s not much you can’t highlight with Weava.</h3></p>

          <div class="insideright">
            <h1> Wait.. What's that?!</h1>
              <p><h3>While you marked up your texts, did you notice anything about your highlights? If you visit any of your markings, you should be able to click the highlighted portion and type an annotation within the highlight that’ll be stored and saved just as your highlights were. Annotations are one of the most important parts of close reading, and Weava doesn’t miss an opportunity to make the online experience as comfortable as it is on paper.</h3></p>

          <div class="insideright">
            <h1>More stuff?</h1>
              <p><h3>Another extended feature within the highlighted portion is the option to pull up the Weava dashboard either on the side of your scrren, or, if you click the little blue house at the top right of the tool bar, you can expand the dashbord into a full page! On the left-hand margin there should be a quick access bar for folders—there, you can organize all of your highlighted documents into their respective folders or subfolders, view a list of your annotations per document, and reopen the original source. With the highlights you’ve done thus far, you should have enough material for the option of making a film folder, future folder, and a LGBT History folder (if you so desired).</h3></p>

            <h1>Cite those marks!!</h1>
              <p><h3>Last but not least, my favorite part! Although it’s mostly up to you to fill it out, Weava has provided a citation template with some auto-generated options to get you started on getting your texts ready for your works-cited page. APA, MLA, Chicago style, and Harvard style are those included, but never just let a template format your citation for you—always triple check! Don’t forget, citations change over time, so this method is only as good as your knowledge of the updated methods of your citation style.</h3></p>

            <h1>Happy highlighting!!</h1>
              <p><h3>I hope this tool proves to be as helpful to you as it is to me, and I’m so excited to continue on working with it. Weava has made digital learning much easier for me, and I’m sure there’s many people out there who could benefit from an in depth, close reading tool such as this. It doesn’t take a lot to get the hang of it, but once you’ve got it, Weava will become a trusted friend—I promise.</h3></p>
